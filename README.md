This repository contains the current draft of a joint white paper that we are preparing based on the findings within the EUHubs4Data Project.
It is based on the [slides presented at the EBDVF 2023](https://european-big-data-value-forum.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EUH4D-EBDVF-2023_TR_Data_Ethics.pdf) and the non-public ethics monitoring report of the [EUHubs4Data Project](https://euhubs4data.eu/) 

Please browse to the build artifacts under the ["Action" tab](https://github.com/EUH4DEthics/Whitepaper/actions) to download an updated prebuild pdf version of the latex sources (you will need to be logged in) or (pre-)released versions via the [releases page](https://github.com/EUH4DEthics/Whitepaper/releases)
