This repository contains the current draft of a joint white paper that we are preparing based on the findings within the EUHubs4Data Project.
It is based on the [slides presented at the EBDVF 2023](https://european-big-data-value-forum.eu/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/EUH4D-EBDVF-2023_TR_Data_Ethics.pdf) and the non-public ethics monitoring report of the [EUHubs4Data Project](https://euhubs4data.eu/) 

Please see the build artifacts under the "Action" tab to download an updated prebuild pdf version of the latex sources.
